## Overview

-   For this project, I used SCSS with the BEM system (since I only write SCSS - BEM), even though it's a small project.

-   When working with media queries, I encountered issues with using rem units, but I used the classic pixels instead.

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS - BEM system
-   Flexbox
-   Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

-   Figma: With this project, I used Figma for the first time, and it really helped me a lot.
-   Documentation: This is the first time I'm writing documentation and using Markdown language in general.

### Continued development

-   I primarily focus on animations, effects, CSS art, and creative coding (canvas JS).

-   Definitely, I want to improve with Figma, in general. I primarily focus on CSS art, animations, effects, and creative coding. I also want to get better at writing documentation, and for Christmas, I plan to dive into React.

### Useful resources

-   [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Personally, I didn't use any resources for this project, but the good old classic is MDN.
